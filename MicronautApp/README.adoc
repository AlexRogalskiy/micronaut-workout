= JPA CRUD application using Micronaut

In this project I am creating an application using Micronaut which will have JPA CRUD capabilities.

This is to explore how we can create a CRUD application using Micronaut and check its performance.

We first create a jar and then create a native image anc compare its performance.

To create a jar simply run `mvn clean package`
then you can run `java -jar target/MicronautApp-0.1.jar` to run the application.

To achieve very high performance we can create a native image using the following command.

```
./mvnw clean package -Dpackaging=native-image
```

You can read more about it in my article here.
