= AWS Lambda function with Micronaut

In this project I am creating an AWS Lambda function using Micronaut.

In this I want to see how we can create a Lambda function and then check its performance.

We deploy this as a jar on a JVM runtime and also try creating a native image.

to create a jar simply run `mvn clean package`

To create a native image for AWS lambda build the native image using the command
```
./mvnw clean package -Dpackaging=docker-native -Dmicronaut.runtime=lambda
```

You can read more about it in my article here.
