= AWS Lambda function with Micronaut

In this project I am creating an AWS Lambda function using Micronaut and then check its performance.

We deploy this as a jar on a JVM runtime and also try creating a native image with AWS custom runtime.

To create a jar simply run `mvn clean package`

To create a native image for AWS lambda, You would need graalvm and then run following the command
```
./mvnw clean package -Dpackaging=docker-native -Dmicronaut.runtime=lambda
```

You can read more about it in my article https://refactorfirst.com/[here].
