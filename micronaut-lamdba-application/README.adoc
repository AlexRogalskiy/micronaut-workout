= AWS Lambda function with Micronaut Application

In this project I am creating an AWS Lambda function which will hold an application that can take in requests from an API gateway. 
This mean I can make different types of requests, using GET, PUT, POST, etc.

Finally then I want to check its performance. 

We can deploy this as a jar on a JVM runtime or create a native image with AWS custom runtime.

To create a jar simply run `mvn clean package`

To create a native image for AWS lambda, You would need graalvm and then run following the command
```
./mvnw clean package -Dpackaging=docker-native -Dmicronaut.runtime=lambda
```

You can read more about it in my article https://refactorfirst.com/[here].
